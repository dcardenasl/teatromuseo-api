## 🎯 Quick Reference

For a condensed, table-based quick reference optimized for rapid lookup:
→ See [`../AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`](../AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)

For hands-on, step-by-step tutorial:
→ See [`../../GETTING_STARTED.md`](../../GETTING_STARTED.md)

## 🧾 Architecture Decisions (ADRs)

Use ADRs for non-negotiable cross-cutting decisions:

1. [ADR-004-OBSERVABILITY-GOVERNANCE.md](../adr/ADR-004-OBSERVABILITY-GOVERNANCE.md)
2. [ADR-005-SERVICE-PURITY-DI.md](../adr/ADR-005-SERVICE-PURITY-DI.md)
3. [ADR-006-FEATURE-TOGGLE-POLICY.md](../adr/ADR-006-FEATURE-TOGGLE-POLICY.md)
4. [ADR-007-SERVICE-RETURN-CONTRACTS.md](../adr/ADR-007-SERVICE-RETURN-CONTRACTS.md)

## 🚨 Handling Architecture Drift

When `composer arch-drift` fails or CI flags a guardrail, consult:
- [DRIFT_GUIDE.md](DRIFT_GUIDE.md) for remediation steps.

## 💡 Tips for Reading

1. **Don't read everything at once** - Follow the roadmap based on your experience level

2. **Read in order** - Each document builds on previous ones

3. **Try the examples** - Create a test resource while reading EXTENSION_GUIDE.md

4. **Use the map** - Jump to specific topics as needed

5. **Refer back** - Keep this README bookmarked for quick navigation

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Reading

Once you've completed the roadmap:

1. **Build something** - Create a new CRUD resource from scratch using `docs/template/CRUD_FROM_ZERO.md`
2. **Read the code** - Examine existing controllers, services, models
3. **Run tests** - See how testing works across all layers
4. **Contribute** - Improve the docs or add features

---

## 🧪 Living Example

Walk through the maintained `Files` resource in `app/Services/Files`, `app/Controllers/Api/V1/Files`, `app/DTO/*/Files`, and its tests to see DTO validation, service orchestration, and documentation artifacts applied in production code.
